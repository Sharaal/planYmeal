# Integrate stripe

- I created a stripe product "planYmeal Premium" with 4,99â‚¬ per month abo
- There should be a "Pricing" Link in the header navigation
- The "Pricing" page should show the infos about the product requested from stripe
    - Features: 
        - Create more than 10 menus
    - Subscribe button
- On click the subscribe button the user should be redirected to the checkout of stripe
- The backend needs to provide webhook `/api/webhooks/stripe`, see https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart
- Webhook signature verification should be implemented for security
- There should be a "subscriptions" table with "userId" (primary key), "status" which can be "trial", "active" or "canceled". Also columns for info from stripe like "stripeCustomerId" and "stripeSubscriptionId"
- The "subscriptions" table will be updated in the webhook
- If the user don't have a subscription or if its status "canceled" there is a limit of 10 menus which can be added. If 10 are reached, the "add menu" button should redirect to the "Pricing" page
- There are some environment variables if needed:
    - STRIPE_API_KEY: API key for stripe requests to the API
    - STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK: The link which should be used on the "Pricing" page
    - STRIPE_PRODUCT_ID: The product ID including the name and the costs
    - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Secret which needs to be given as query param to the webhook
- Stripe customer should be created on first subscription attempt
- Default state for new users is not having a subscription
- Subscription status display should be visible on an account page, which can be reached by clicking on the user in the header. The status should be linked with the stripe dashboard for the user to be able to cancel their subscription
- After subscribe the user is redirect to the "Calendar" page
